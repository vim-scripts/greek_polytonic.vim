This is a keyboard layout useful to native Greek speakers and Greek
scholars (Hellenists) who wish to use Vim/gVim to type traditional Greek
(often referred to as multi-accented or polytonic).

This layout allows the typing of multi-accented (polytonic) Greek
text in the manner of writing by hand.  Accents and breathings are typed
after the vowels in any order without dead keys. In other words, first we 
type the letter and then we "decorate" it with the required accents.  This
serves for a more comfortable typing of Greek.  Furthermore it allows easier
correction of errors. A wrong accent (or no accent) can be replaced with
with the correct one without deleting the character.  We simply place the
cursor to the right of the vowel and press the required accent.  If the
character can take the accent, it will be replaced by the accented version
of the same character.
--------------------------------------------------------------
The main accent keys are as follows:

/              Oxia (acute)
\              Varia (grave)
~ (or =)   Perispomeni (circumflex)
]               Psili  (lenis)
[               Dasia (asper)
"               Dialytika (diaeresis)
|               Ypogegrammeni (Iota subscript)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Examples. 
Typing the sequence:    a/, will give Small Alpha with Oxia.
Typing:  a/]  or  a]/   will give Small Alpha with Oxia and Psili.
Typing:  a, followed by any combination of /,],|, will give 
              Small Alpha with Oxia and Psili and Ypogegrammeni.

Typing of multi-accented Greek is easier this way because this method is 
similar to the way we write by hand.  Only a few accent keys are used 
(easier to memorize). See the included table. Also read the source file.

You can still use the dead keys of the modern Greek keymap. For example,
 Alpha with Tonos can be derived either with "a/" or with ";a".

Installation:

  Copy the file greek_polytonic.vim to your home .vim  keymap directory
  (~/.vim/keymap/) If the directory does not exist, create it.




Usage:

  * Load the keymap:
              set keymap=greek_polytonic
  * Set encodings:  
              set encoding=utf-8
              set inputenc=utf-8
              set fenc=utf-8
 
  * Set vim to use a monospaced unicode font that includes all the "Greek Extented" characters and symbols.
     Example: set guifont=Consolas\ Regular\ 16
     Note: for m$ windows this should be:  set guifont=Consolas:h16

  Examples of suitable fonts are:

    Dejavu Sans mono
    Courier New
    Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
    Consolas 
 
* Also switch the keyboard to Greek with ALT-SHIFT (or whatever)

* To type any of the actual symbols of the accent keys (/, \, ] , [, .. etc.,)  
   you can toggle off the keymap with CTRL-^.



Notes: 

   Consolas is a Microsoft font found in Windows 7 (The Consolas font
   shipped with Windows Vista is not suitable - has no extended Greek
   characters). It is a very good monospaced font for displaying
   and for printing polytonic Greek text.  (Microsoft is very good to us
   Greek scholars). Here is a screenshot of vim editing the text of 
   Ptolemy's Almagest displayed in 16 pt Consolas:

   If you have problems with printing greek utf-8 use
   paps (http://paps.sourceforge.net/)
   I use it from within vim by creating a command as folows:
   :command Paps write !paps --font=Consolas\ 10 | lpr
