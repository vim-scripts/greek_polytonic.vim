This is a keyboard layout useful to native Greek speakers and Greek
scholars (Hellenists) who wish to use Vim/gVim to type traditional Greek
(often referred to as multi-accented or polytonic).

This layout allows the typing of multi-accented (polytonic) Greek
text in the manner of writing by hand.  Accents and breathings are typed
after the vowels in any order without dead keys. In other words, first we 
type the letter and then we "decorate" it with the required accents.  This
serves for a more comfortable typing of Greek.  Furthermore it allows easier
correction of errors. A wrong accent (or no accent) can be replaced with
with the correct one without deleting the character.  We simply place the
cursor to the right of the vowel and press the required accent.  If the
character can take the accent, it will be replaced by the accented version
of the same character.

Examples: a/, will give Small Alpha with Oxia.
          a/] or a]/ will give Small Alpha with Oxia and Psili.
          a, followed by any combination of /,],|, will give Small Alpha with 
          Oxia and Psili and Ypogegrammeni.

Typing of multi-accented Greek is easier this way because we need to memorize
only a few accent keys. See the attached table. Also read the source file.



Installation:

  Copy the file greek_polytonic.vim to your home .vim  keymap directory
  (~/.vim/keymap/) If the directory does not exist, create it.




Usage:

  Load the keymap:
              set keymap=greek_polytonic
  Set encodings:  
              set encoding=utf-8
              set inputenc=utf-8
              set fenc=utf-8
 
  Set vim to use a monospaced unicode font that includes all the "Greek
  Extented" characters and symbols.
  Example: set guifont=Consolas\ Regular\ 16

  Examples of suitable fonts are:

    Dejavu Sans mono
    Courier New
    Bitstream Vera Sans Mono
    Consolas 
 
  Also switch the keyboard to Greek with ALT-SHIFT (or whatever)



Notes: 

   Consolas is a Microsoft font found in Windows 7 (The Consolas font
   shipped with Windows Vista is not suitable - no extended Greek
   characters). It is a very good monospaced font for both displaying
   and for printing polytonic Greek text. (Microsoft is very good to us
   Greek scholars).

   If you have problems with printing greek utf-8 use
   paps (http://paps.sourceforge.net/)
   I use it from within vim by creating a command as folows:
   :command Paps write !paps --font=Consolas\ 10 | lpr
